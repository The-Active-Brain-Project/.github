  ðŸ§  Active Brain Project
</h1>

Welcome to the Active Brain Project GitHub organisation. This hub hosts the scripts and workflows developed by our team at University College London (UCL).

The project explores how lifestyle factors â€” such as sleep, stress, physical activity, and nutrition â€” affect cognitive performance and wellbeing. Using wearable devices, questionnaires, and cognitive tasks, we aim to generate insights that support health and workplace wellbeing.
